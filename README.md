## 🔌 Backend Integration Note (Important)

Firebase is selected as the backend platform for this project.

For the scope of this rebranding task, content is managed through structured data models and service abstractions that simulate CMS-driven workflows. This approach keeps the application lightweight while ensuring it can be easily extended to Firebase Firestore or Strapi for full dynamic content management if required.

UI components are fully decoupled from data sources, allowing seamless backend integration without refactoring.
